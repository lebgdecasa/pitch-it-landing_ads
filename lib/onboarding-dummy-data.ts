  description: 'MiraMist is a portable aromatherapy diffuser crafted for travelers, remote workers, and mindful minimalists who want to stay grounded wherever they go. Unlike bulky diffusers that require outlets, water refills, or fragile glass containers, MiraMist is waterless, spill-proof, and USB-C rechargeable—fitting comfortably in the palm of your hand or the side pocket of a tote. Users insert essential oil pods—each pre-dosed and mess-free—into the device, which releases ultra-fine, silent bursts of therapeutic mist on demand. With mood presets like Focus, Calm, Sleep, and Energy, MiraMist adapts to your routine with one-touch simplicity. Whether you’re preparing for a big meeting, winding down on a flight, or centering yourself during a walk, you’ll have instant access to your favorite blend. With its matte finish, minimalist design, and hypoallergenic materials, MiraMist feels as good in your hand as it smells in the air. It’s the wellness ritual you didn’t know you needed—subtle, soothing, and always with you. For those who live fast but seek moments of stillness, MiraMist turns every breath into a reset.',
