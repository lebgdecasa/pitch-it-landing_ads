🎯 **VCs: How many deals did you pass on last week?**

**The brutal truth:**
You're not passing on bad deals.
You're passing on deals you can't validate fast enough.

**Last month alone:**
→ 847 pitch decks received
→ 23 made it to partner meeting  
→ 3 got term sheets
→ 1 had real validation data

**The problem isn't deal flow.**
**It's validation speed.**

**What if you could validate any startup's claims in 72 hours?**

✅ Real user feedback from target market
✅ Competitive positioning analysis
✅ Market demand verification  
✅ PMF validation report

**Stop guessing. Start validating.**
